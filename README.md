# calculator
This is my calculator project. The languages used are HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.
This calculator can handle multiple number inputs, carry out division, multiplication, addition and subtraction.
It also allows the user to input decimal, positive, negative numbers and can convert numbers into percentages.
